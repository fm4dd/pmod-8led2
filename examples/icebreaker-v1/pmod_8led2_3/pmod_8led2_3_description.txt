This program is a binary counter, demonstrating the function of the 8LED2 PMOD under VHDL.

The functionality has been converted from the Verilog program pmod_8led2_2.v. It has been tested on a Icebreaker and ULX3S board, using the Linux open source workflow (yosys, nextpnr, icestorm and fujprog for the board-specific programming). The yosys GHDL synthesis works fine on the VHDL code.
