This program is a binary counter, demonstrating the function of the 8LED2 PMOD under VHDL. 

The functionality has been converted from the Verilog program pmod_8led2_2.v, tested on a Icebreaker v1.0 board, using the Linux open source workflow (yosys, nextpnr, and icestorm). Without an open source VHDL workflow, I am testing VHDL on a DE0-Nano-SoC board with Quartus Prime Version 17.1 Lite Edition on Windows.
